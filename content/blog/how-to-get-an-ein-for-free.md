### Introduction
Forming an LLC in the U.S. can be exciting, but then you realize that you can open a business bank account especially if you are a non-US citizen or resident.

If you can not open a business account for your newly formed LLC, then you can't receive payment, and one major requirement to open a business bank account is the EIN - Employer Identification Number.

Unfortunately, there is so much false information online regarding non-US citizens and non-US residents (foreigners) obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS.

A majority of the information is inaccurate or insufficient, either as a result of limited understanding or an attempt to push a sale on you.

Here are the things you should keep in mind as we proceed:
- You don't need to pay to get an EIN
- You don't need to be a U.S citizen or U.S resident to get an EIN
- You don't need an SSN to get an EIN
- You don't need an ITIN to get an EIN
- You don't need a Third Party Designee to get an EIN
- You don't need a lawyer or accountant to get an EIN
- You don't need a U.S. address to get an EIN

Whether you are a U.S. citizen or not, this blog post will guide you on how to get an EIN seamlessly without having to pay a dime to any agent.

### What is an EIN?
An Employer Identification Number aids the IRS in identifying your business for tax purposes. Small lenders and financial institutions will require this number before granting access to financial products for your small business. Each EIN consists of nine digits, and no two businesses can be allocated identical EINs. The format includes a hyphen between the second and third digits, creating XX-XXXXXXX.

### Why You Need an EIN
Starting a partnership requires obtaining an EIN, which is mandated by the IRS for specific fields. To employ workers and acquire business permits, business owners must possess this tax identification number. Nevertheless, it's not required to have an EIN to collaborate with freelancers. If you have a Keogh retirement plan or withhold taxes on non-wage income, you will also require an EIN.

Business owners who have EINs can establish business bank accounts to distinguish personal finances from business finances. Keeping personal and business tax returns separate can simplify tax filing and help accurately determine the amount of income tax owed.

Your EIN will be used for U.S. tax reporting and filing obligations, as well as for hiring employees (if necessary) and obtaining sales tax licenses/permits.

The EIN of your LLC will be used to sign up for accounts on platforms such as eBay, Amazon FBA, Youtube, Google Adsense, Shopify, Paypal, Stripe, and others.

An EIN also offers increased privacy by allowing you to utilize it for crucial business paperwork instead of your Social Security Number. Having additional privacy can lower the chances of becoming a victim of identity theft.

### How Long Does it Take to Get an EIN?
The amount of time it takes to receive an EIN varies depending on the method of application used. If you submit your application online, you'll get a quick response.

If you send your application via fax may extend the processing time from two weeks to four weeks

If you send your application through the mail (not email) it may extend the processing time to six months. Send your EIN application by mail, may take as long as four weeks to eight weeks for you to hear back from the IRS.

### How to Apply for an EIN Online
The process of applying online for a free EIN is simple. To apply for an EIN, you must have any of the following:
- a legitimate Social Security Number (SSN),
- a valid Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), or
- an active EIN

If you have any of these, you can begin by following these steps.

<br/>

**Step 1: Visit The IRS Website**
The application process for the IRS is simple and easy to follow. You must go to the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online) to begin the process.

<br/>

**Step 2: Fill in the form**
The IRS will inquire about the purpose of your EIN request and who is responsible for the company's tax matters.

You will need to provide essential details such as your:

- Full name,
- Type of business entity,
- Business location, and
- Contact number.

You have the option to get a confirmation letter either online or through regular mail.

Getting confirmation through postal mail may take a couple of weeks, whereas online delivery provides instant access to your confirmation.

You must finish the entire application in one go as the session will end after 15 minutes of inactivity. If that occurs, you will need to begin the application process from the beginning.

<br/>

**Step 3: Review your EIN application**
It will only take you a minute or two to cross-check your EIN application and make sure there are no errors. Going over your application can prevent additional complications down the line.

<br/>

**Step 4: Submit your application**
Once you are super confident with your EIN application, itâ€™s time to submit it. If you apply online, you can instantly receive your EIN.

### What happens if you lose your EIN?
If you lose your EIN, you should first search for the online letter you received from the IRS upon getting approved. You can also look through your filed tax returns, which list your EIN, or contact the bank that provides your business accounts. You can also call the IRS Business & Specialty Tax Line during business hours if you can't find your EIN.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What does the EIN reference number 101 mean?**
An EIN Error 101 occurs when the IRS identifies a different entity with the same business name. If you receive an Error 101 after submitting your EIN, you will need to submit a new application for your EIN using form SS-4.

**Can I get an EIN if I'm not a US citizen?**
A common misconception is that an individual needs a Social Security number (SSN) to obtain a business EIN, but this is not true. Foreigners who own businesses can obtain a business EIN even without having an SSN.

**Is US tax ID the same as EIN?**
A Federal Tax Identification Number also referred to as a "95 Number", "E.I.N. Number," or "Tax I.D. Number", is a nine-digit number issued by the IRS. Different titles refer to identical numerical value.
